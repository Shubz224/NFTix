# NFTix - Blockchain-based Event Ticket Booking System

## Overview
*NFTix* is a decentralized event ticket booking platform built on blockchain technology, using *POAPs* (Proof of Attendance Protocol) and *NFTs* as event tickets. This innovative system ensures secure, authentic, and fraud-proof ticketing by leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability.

## Features
- *Blockchain-based Ticketing: Each event ticket is issued as an **NFT* that acts as a QR code for entry.
- *Secure and Transparent*: Prevents counterfeiting, ensuring that tickets are authentic and traceable.
- *Smart Contracts*: Smart contracts manage ticket issuance, transfers, and event access dynamically.
- *Seamless User Experience*: Users can easily purchase, transfer, and verify tickets using blockchain technology.
- *POAP Integration*: Integrates POAPs for events, ensuring attendees receive verifiable attendance proof.
- *Decentralized Access*: Tickets stored as NFTs provide users with decentralized control over their event access.
